This spiny, black bone spear is a favorite among nocturnal hunting tribes. While attuned to the spear, you can always see the faint outline of it, even in total darkness. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This spear contains a fragment of the moonless hunter, an ancient spirit that can be channeled to assume some of its powers. While you’re not channeling the spirit, you can use a bonus action while holding this spear to call forth the magic within it and assume the spirit of the moonless hunter. While you’re assuming this spirit, your eyes become pure white, and you gain the following benefits: • You ignore the effects of exhaustion.  
• You can’t sleep or be put to sleep by magical means, and you can’t take or benefit from finishing a long rest.  
• You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks made to detect and track creatures.  
• You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a range of 120 feet.  
• Your attacks with the "blackthorn spear of the moonless hunter" deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any creature it hits.  
• Your movement speed increases by 5 feet.

You can assume the spirit in this way for up to 8 hours or until you release it as a bonus action. The effect ends early if you are more than 120 feet away from the "blackthorn spear of the moonless hunter" for more than 1 minute. When the effect ends and you are no longer assuming the spirit of the moonless hunter, you gain 2 levels of exhaustion as the spirit returns to the spear. Exhaustion gained in this way can only be reduced by finishing a long rest.
